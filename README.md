This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in shell scripting related to wildcard expansion and word splitting.  The `bug.sh` script attempts to process all `.txt` files in the directory. However, if filenames contain spaces or special characters, the script fails because of improper variable expansion. The `bugSolution.sh` script provides a corrected version using array processing for robust handling of filenames with special characters and spaces.
